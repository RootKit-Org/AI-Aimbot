## 🙌 Welcome Aboard!
We're a charity on a mission to educate and certify the upcoming wave of developers in the world of Computer Engineering 🌍. Need assistance? Hop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rootkitorg) and toss your questions.

Our *AI Aimbot* 🤖 sharpshoots targets in **any game with humanoid characters**, harnessing the power of [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics). Currently, it's a ninja against anti-cheat systems, as it's visual-only. Still, watch out for manual player reports! 👀

Intended for educational use 🎓, our aim is to highlight the vulnerability of game devs to AI-driven cheats. Pass it along to your game developer buddies, and save their games from being outsmarted!

**⚠ Use at your own risk! If you're caught... well, you've been warned!**
